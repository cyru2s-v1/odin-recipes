    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Steak and eggs is a classic dish that typically consists of a grilled or pan-seared steak served alongside eggs, often prepared sunny-side up, over easy, or scrambled. The steak can be seasoned with various herbs and spices and cooked to the desired level of doneness, ranging from rare to well-done. It's a hearty and protein-rich breakfast or brunch option that provides a satisfying combination of flavors and textures. The eggs complement the savory taste of the steak, and the dish is sometimes accompanied by sides such as toast, hash browns, or vegetables.</p>
